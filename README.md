## Barcode Synthesizer
Creates a set of realistically looking barcodes images and a textfile containing the values.

## Motivation
There is a lack of useful barcodes datasets e.g. for training a barcode-decoder network.<br /> 
So I started writing a script that creates such a dataset with a barcode generator and 
rotates the barcodes in the 3D-plane, adds noise, changes brightness and intensity 
and adds blurring.<br /> 
The goal is to reduce the reality gap as much as possible.
